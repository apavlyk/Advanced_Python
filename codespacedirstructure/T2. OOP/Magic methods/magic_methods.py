        Representing your Classes
        It’s often useful to have a string representation of a class. In Python, there’s a few methods
        that you can implement in your class definition to customize how built in functions that return
        representations of your class behave.
        __str__(self) Defines behavior for when str() is called on an instance of your class.
        __repr__(self) Defines behavior for when repr() is called on an instance of your class. The
        major difference between str() and repr() is intended audience. repr() is intended to
        produce output that is mostly machine-readable (in many cases, it could be valid Python
        code even), whereas str() is intended to be human-readable.
        __unicode__(self) Defines behavior for when unicode() is called on an instance of your class.
        unicode() is like str(), but it returns a unicode string. Be wary: if a client calls str()
        on an instance of your class and you’ve only defined __unicode__(), it won’t work. You
        should always try to define __str__() as well in case someone doesn’t have the luxury of
        using unicode.
        __format__(self, formatstr) Defines behavior for when an instance of your class is used in
        new-style string formatting. For instance, "Hello, 0:abc!".format(a) would lead to
        the call a.__format__("abc"). This can be useful for defining your own numerical or
        string types that you might like to give special formatting options.
        __hash__(self) Defines behavior for when hash() is called on an instance of your class. It
        has to return an integer, and its result is used for quick key comparison in dictionaries.
        Note that this usually entails implementing __eq__ as well. Live by the following rule: a
        == b implies hash(a) == hash(b).
        __nonzero__(self) Defines behavior for when bool() is called on an instance of your class.
        Should return True or False, depending on whether you would want to consider the instance
        to be True or False.
        __dir__(self) : Defines behavior for when dir() is called on an instance of your class. This
        method should return a list of attributes for the user. Typically, implementing __dir_-
        _ is unnecessary, but it can be vitally important for interactive use of your classes if you
        redefine __getattr__ or __getattribute__ (which you will see in the next section) or
        are otherwise dynamically generating attributes.

        (or return NotImplemented) for its definition of the non-reflected version of an operation. For

        Python also has a wide variety of magic methods to allow custom behavior to be defined

        here’s an example:
        x = 5
        x += 1 # in other words x = x + 1

        Type conversion magic methods
        Python also has an array of magic methods designed to implement behavior for built in type
        conversion functions like float(). Here they are:
        __int__(self) Implements type conversion to int.
        __long__(self) Implements type conversion to long.
        __float__(self) Implements type conversion to float.
        __complex__(self) Implements type conversion to complex.
        __oct__(self) Implements type conversion to octal.
        __hex__(self) Implements type conversion to hexadecimal.
        __index__(self) Implements type conversion to an int when the object is used in a slice
        expression. If you define a custom numeric type that might be used in slicing, you should
        define __index__.
        __trunc__(self) Called when math.trunc(self) is called. __trunc__ should return the
        value of self truncated to an integral type (usually a long).
        __coerce__(self, other) Method to implement mixed mode arithmetic. __coerce__ should
        return None if type conversion is impossible. Otherwise, it should return a pair (2-tuple)
        of self and other, manipulated to have the same type.
